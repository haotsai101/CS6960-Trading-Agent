# Meridian — Equity Portfolio Management System (v4)

## System Purpose

Meridian is a portfolio management dashboard for an active equity portfolio of approximately $1M across 200–300 open positions. The portfolio is managed by **multiple manager teams** deploying three strategy types: fundamental (single-position), systematic (multi-position baskets with periodic reconstruction), and macroeconomic (multi-position baskets driven by macro themes). The system serves the CIO/lead PM with six operational workflows: weekly operational review, risk monitoring, portfolio construction and rebalancing, post-trade analysis, proactive alerting, and manager/strategy performance attribution.

## Architecture Summary

The frontend is a single-page React application with six tabbed modules. Each module consumes data from a backend API that queries a relational database and performs computed analytics.

| Module | Tab Label | Primary Use Case |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Weekly Review | Operational heartbeat — "how am I doing?" |
| 2 | Risk Analytics | Risk monitoring — "what could go wrong?" |
| 3 | Construction | Portfolio structure — "what should I change?" |
| 4 | Closed Positions | Post-trade learning — "what worked and what didn't?" |
| 5 | Alerts & Attention | Proactive intelligence — "what needs my attention now?" |
| 6 | Manager Performance | Team and strategy attribution — "who is generating alpha?" |

## Global Configuration

The system uses several user-configurable parameters stored in a `portfolio_settings` table:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `aytd_start_date` | `2025-09-01` | Reset date for AYTD (Annualized Year-to-Date) calculations |
| `inception_date` | `2024-09-01` | Fund inception date for max-horizon return calculations |
| `benchmark_symbol` | `SPY` | Benchmark ETF for comparative analytics |
| `max_position_weight` | `5.0%` | Hard cap on any single position |
| `max_sector_overweight` | `5.0%` | Max deviation from benchmark sector weight |
| `factor_ceiling` | `1.0σ` | Max factor exposure deviation |
| `drawdown_trigger` | `-5.0%` | Sector or position drawdown that triggers review |
| `correlation_flag` | `0.75` | Pairwise correlation threshold for alerts |
| `stop_loss_default` | `-8.0%` | Default stop loss from cost basis |
| `max_positions` | `300` | Position count capacity |
| `cash_target_pct` | `4.0%` | Target cash allocation |

## Database Schema Overview

The system requires the following core tables:

### Reference Data
- `securities` — Symbol, name, sector (GICS), industry (GICS sub-industry), market cap category, and factor loadings
- `benchmark_weights` — Current benchmark (SPY) sector and position weights, updated monthly
- `earnings_calendar` — Upcoming earnings dates for held securities
- `macro_events` — Fed meetings, CPI releases, and other macro catalysts

### Manager & Strategy Data
- `manager_teams` — Organizational units responsible for groups of strategies (team_id, name, description, lead_manager, inception_date, is_active)
- `strategies` — Named investment initiatives owned by a manager team (strategy_id, team_id FK, name, type [fundamental/systematic/macroeconomic], status [active/inactive], thesis, inception_date, closed_date, rebalance_frequency, benchmark_symbol)
- `strategy_reconstructions` — Log of reconstruction events within multi-position strategies (reconstruction_id, strategy_id FK, date, period_number, positions_added[], positions_removed[], note, prior_period_return_pct)
- `strategy_snapshots` — Daily time series of strategy-level market value, daily return, cumulative index, and realized P&L

### Portfolio Data
- `positions` — Current open positions with entry date, cost basis, shares, current market value, **`strategy_id` FK**, and **`reconstruction_period`**
- `closed_positions` — Historical closed trades with entry/exit dates, prices, P&L, hold duration, exit reason, **`strategy_id` FK**, and **`reconstruction_period`**
- `transactions` — Full trade log imported from broker exports. Every row carries a `ticker` (the broker-provided symbol, or `CASH` for cash-only movements), a raw `action` (the broker's original label), a normalized `category`, a `strategy_id` FK, and standard fields (date, quantity, price, amount, fees). See [Transaction Taxonomy](#transaction-taxonomy) for the full classification.

### Transaction Taxonomy

Broker-exported actions are mapped to five normalized categories. The `ticker` field preserves the broker-provided security symbol for all security-referenced actions; only pure cash movements use the synthetic symbol `CASH`.

| Category | `ticker` | Broker Actions | Notes |
|----------|----------|----------------|-------|
| `trade` | Security ticker | Buy, Sell | Core trade activity. Drives position open/close logic. |
| `corporate_action` | Security ticker | Stock Split, Return Of Capital, Return Of Cap Adj | Affects share count or cost basis on the referenced position. |
| `income` | Security ticker | Cash Dividend, Qualified Dividend, Non-Qualified Div, Special Qual Div, Special Non Qual Div, Special Dividend, Pr Yr Non-Qual Div, Pr Yr Cash Div | Cash received but attributed to the source security. Needed for per-position income tracking, yield calculations, and tax reporting. |
| `fee` | Security ticker | ADR Mgmt Fee, Foreign Tax Paid | Costs attributable to a specific holding. Relevant for total cost of ownership and tax credit calculations. |
| `cash_movement` | `CASH` | Wire Received, Bank Interest, Funds Paid, Stop Check Payment | No security reference. Affects only the cash balance. |

**`transactions` Table Schema**

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `transaction_id` | UUID, PK | Unique identifier |
| `date` | DATE | Transaction date |
| `ticker` | VARCHAR(10) | Broker-provided security symbol, or `CASH` for cash-only movements |
| `action` | VARCHAR(50) | Raw broker action label (e.g., "Qualified Dividend", "Buy") |
| `category` | ENUM('trade','corporate_action','income','fee','cash_movement') | Normalized category for querying and reporting |
| `quantity` | DECIMAL(14,6), nullable | Share quantity (positive for buys/splits, negative for sells; null for cash-only) |
| `price` | DECIMAL(12,4), nullable | Per-share price (null for dividends, fees, cash movements) |
| `amount` | DECIMAL(14,2) | Net dollar amount (positive = cash inflow, negative = cash outflow) |
| `fees` | DECIMAL(10,2), default 0 | Commission or other transaction fees |
| `strategy_id` | UUID, FK → `strategies`, nullable | Strategy context. Null for cash movements and unassigned legacy transactions. |
| `security_id` | UUID, FK → `securities`, nullable | Normalized security reference. Null when `ticker = 'CASH'`. |
| `description` | TEXT, nullable | Broker-provided description or notes |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Record import/creation time |

**Indexes**: `(date, ticker)`, `(strategy_id)`, `(category)`, `(ticker, category)`.

**Import rules**:
1. Parse the broker's `Action` field and map to `category` using the table above.
2. If `category = 'cash_movement'`, set `ticker = 'CASH'`, `quantity = NULL`, `price = NULL`.
3. For all other categories, preserve the broker-provided ticker and attempt to match to `securities.ticker` for the `security_id` FK.
4. `strategy_id` is assigned either during import (if the broker export includes account/strategy tags) or manually after import via a mapping UI.

### Time Series
- `portfolio_snapshots` — Daily portfolio-level NAV, cash, position count, and return index value
- `position_snapshots` — Daily per-position market value and weight
- `benchmark_snapshots` — Daily benchmark index value (rebased to 100 at inception and AYTD start)

### Analytics (Computed, Cached)
- `risk_metrics` — Rolling VaR, CVaR, volatility, beta, alpha, Sharpe, Sortino, max drawdown, tracking error at multiple windows (30d, 90d, 180d, 1Y)
- `correlation_matrix` — Rolling 90-day pairwise correlations for top N positions and for sectors
- `return_distribution` — Binned daily return frequencies for the VaR histogram
- `factor_exposures` — Portfolio-level and position-level factor loadings (Momentum, Quality, Value, Size, Volatility)
- `drawdown_series` — Daily peak-to-trough drawdown time series

### Alerts
- `alert_rules` — Configurable alert rule definitions with thresholds
- `alert_instances` — Generated alert records with category, severity, message, symbol reference, and timestamp
